# IA-project
"This is a project built using the MERN stack that utilizes OpenAI's API to create a chatbot that can perform text-to-speech and speech-to-text functionality. Users can interact with the program using their voice, and the program will respond using text-to-speech technology. Additionally, the program keeps a record of the conversation history. This project is inspired by ChatGPT and expands on its features by integrating speech technology. Users can enjoy a more interactive experience with the program, which opens up a wide range of possibilities for future applications.
